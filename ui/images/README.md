# UI Images

This folder is reserved for UI-local images if we choose to bundle assets with the UI app.

Recommended placement for the main logo during development:
- Copy `../../images/Flovify-logo.png` here or reference the root-level path directly in the app’s public folder.

When we scaffold the Vite app, we’ll likely use `ui/public/Flovify-logo.png` to make the asset available at `/Flovify-logo.png` or `/ui/Flovify-logo.png` depending on base URL.
