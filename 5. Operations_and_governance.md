# Operations & Governance — AI Workflow Automation Agency

## Purpose
Establish a **smart and simple operational framework** to ensure reliability, compliance, and observability across all deployed AI workflow automation systems. Operations and governance safeguard client trust, data security, and system performance while enabling scalable, predictable delivery.

---

## 1. Guiding Principles
1. **Transparency:** Every workflow action must be traceable and auditable.
2. **Reliability:** Systems must remain observable, recoverable, and predictable.
3. **Security by Design:** Sensitive data is protected end-to-end through consistent policies.
4. **Simplicity:** Processes are as lean as possible — no unnecessary layers or tools.

---

## 2. Core Operational Domains
| Domain | Focus | Goal |
|---------|--------|------|
| **Monitoring & Observability** | Workflow runs, states, and diagnostics (backed by metrics/logs/traces) | Detect, understand, and resolve incidents quickly with run-level clarity. |
| **Security & Compliance** | Data privacy, access control | Protect client data, meet PII and SOC2-level expectations. |
| **Incident Management** | Detection, response, resolution | Minimize downtime and ensure communication transparency. |
| **Change Management** | Controlled releases and rollbacks | Maintain production stability during rapid evolution. |
| **Business Continuity** | Backups, recovery, DR planning | Ensure resilience against data loss or service outage. |

---

## 3. Monitoring & Observability
- **Workflow Management View (primary):** run list, run detail with state graph, retries, failure reasons, annotations, and HITL decisions.
- **Business KPIs (client-facing):** time-to-feature (time to benefit), effectiveness and quality indicators, staff pressure relief (capacity utilization/queue depth), customer experience (CSAT/NPS), and turnaround/response time.
- **Engineering Metrics (internal):** latency, resource usage per request (token/compute), error rates, uptime, retries.
- **Diagnostics:** request-level traces (OpenTelemetry, LangGraph session IDs) and structured JSON logs per workflow step.
- **Dashboards:** Prometheus + Grafana for live visibility and trend analysis.
- **Alerts:** automated notifications on thresholds (latency, failures, resource overuse).

**Reporting stance:** client dashboards lead with the workflow management view and business KPIs; technical tabs (traces/metrics/logs) are available for transparency and troubleshooting.

**Outcome:** clear, real-time view of business impact, with underlying system health and resource-performance tradeoffs for operators.

---

## 4. Security & Compliance
- **Access Control:** role-based access via OAuth and API tokens.
- **Data Handling:** PII redaction before LLM interaction.
- **Secrets Management:** all credentials stored in Vault/SOPS or environment variables.
- **Network Security:** HTTPS/TLS everywhere; no public database ports.
- **Audit Logging:** every change and access logged with timestamps.

**Outcome:** consistent compliance with privacy and data protection standards.

---

## 5. Incident Management
**Lifecycle:** detect → analyze → communicate → resolve → document.

**Practices:**
- Incident playbooks per service (API, LangGraph, n8n, DB).
- Severity levels (S1–S3) with response times.
- Root Cause Analysis (RCA) after resolution.
- Communication checklist: internal + client notification.

**Outcome:** predictable response and learning from every issue.

---

## 6. Change Management
- **Version Control:** Git branches for every feature; PR review required.
- **Release Tags:** semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- **Deployment Policy:** staging first, automated tests, manual approval for production.
- **Rollback Plan:** one-command reversion of last stable image.
- **Changelog Automation:** auto-generated from commits.

**Outcome:** safe, repeatable, and reversible change process.

---

## 7. Backup & Disaster Recovery
| Component | Backup Frequency | Retention | Restore Target |
|------------|------------------|------------|----------------|
| Postgres | Daily snapshot | 7–30 days | < 1 hour |
| Vector DB | Daily dump | 7 days | < 2 hours |
| Object Storage (S3/MinIO) | Incremental | 30 days | < 2 hours |
| Config / Secrets | Versioned | Until revoked | Immediate |

**Outcome:** resilience and fast recovery in case of failure.

---

## 8. Governance Practices
- **RACI Matrix:** clearly define who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed.
- **Policies:** code review, PII handling, eval documentation, access audits.
- **Risk Register:** track identified risks, mitigation, and owners.
- **Continuous Improvement:** quarterly reviews of incidents, metrics, and client feedback.

**Outcome:** managed growth and sustainable reliability.
