# **Carousel Layout: AI Workflow Automation — When No-Code Delivers and When More Is Required**

---

## **Slide 1 — Hook: The No‑Code Illusion**
**Title:** When No‑Code Delivers and When More Is Required  
**Subtitle:** AI Workflow Automation for Small Teams That Need Big Results  
**Visual:** Split image — left side: simple no‑code blocks; right side: tangled node graph.  
**Tagline:** No‑code is brilliant… until it isn’t.

---

## **Slide 2 — The Reality Check**
**Header:** When “simple” turns complex.  
**Bullets:**  
- Custom scripts and brittle branches creep in fast.  
- Ad‑hoc webhooks and messy data flows.  
- No visibility into what’s running — or why it failed.  
**Visual:** Cracked automation flow diagram.

---

## **Slide 3 — The Ceiling We Hit**
**Header:** Why AI + No‑Code stalled for us.  
**Bullets:**  
- Hard to get targeted functionality without orchestration.  
- Inconsistent outputs over time (prompt drift).  
- Node sprawl — too many steps, hard to evolve.  
**Visual:** Timeline of rising complexity vs control.

---

## **Slide 4 — The Hybrid Answer**
**Header:** The Hybrid Approach: No‑Code + Coded Backbone  
**Bullets:**  
- **No‑code where it fits:** triggers, OAuth, pre‑defined AI nodes.  
- **Code where it counts:** decisions, safety, orchestration, versioning.  
- **LangChain graphs** provide structure, reliability, and traceability.  
**Visual:** Layered architecture diagram — No‑Code surface → LangChain backbone → Supervisory UI.

---

## **Slide 5 — The Vibe Coding Layer**
**Header:** The Supervisory UI and Vibe Coding  
**Bullets:**  
- Vibe coding builds the backbone + UI for visibility and diagnostics.  
- Helps maintain flow, readability, and testability.  
- But like no‑code, it has its own limits — another topic to explore.  
**Visual:** Screenshot or mock‑up of diagnostic UI with state timeline and run log.

---

## **Slide 6 — Measuring Outcomes**
**Header:** How We Measure Success  
**Bullets:**  
- ⏱️ Time‑to‑Feature (time to benefit)  
- ✅ First‑Pass Success / Quality  
- ⚙️ AI Contribution Stability & Reliability  
Supporting metrics: p95 run duration & resource usage.  
**Visual:** Dashboard mock‑up with these KPIs visible.
