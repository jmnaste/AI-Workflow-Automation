# Platform Architecture — AI Workflow Automation Agency

## Purpose
Establish a clear, concise, and efficient view of the technical architecture supporting the agency’s AI workflow automation platform. The goal is to balance **clarity**, **scalability**, and **maintainability** — keeping the system smart and simple while enabling enterprise-grade reliability.

---

## 1. Architectural Overview
The platform integrates reasoning, automation, and visibility through a clean layered design:

> **Dashboard (Front-Office)** ⇄ **FastAPI + LangGraph Engine (Back-Office)** ⇄ **Data Stores (Memory & State)** ⇄ **n8n / Integrations (Ops Layer)**

Each layer serves a distinct purpose yet interacts fluidly via well-defined interfaces.

---

## 2. Component Roles
| Layer | Component | Role |
|-------|------------|------|
| **Front-Office** | **Dashboard (Streamlit / React)** | Visualizes results, KPIs, and human-in-the-loop interactions. Enables clients to understand automation impact. |
| **Core Engine** | **FastAPI** | Exposes APIs, orchestrates LangGraph executions, manages user requests, and enforces policies. |
| | **LangGraph** | Executes cognitive workflows (plan → retrieve → decide → act → reflect). Manages reasoning, state, and agent coordination. |
| **Memory Layer** | **Postgres + PGVector** | Stores persistent data, embeddings, workflow states, and context retrieval for RAG operations. |
| **Integration Layer** | **n8n / Custom Connectors** | Handles SaaS integration, triggers, OAuth authentication, and scheduled automations. Serves as operational plumbing, not client interface. |
| **Observability** | **Telemetry Stack (Prometheus / Grafana / OTEL)** | Collects metrics, logs, and traces for debugging, cost tracking, and performance tuning. |
| **Storage** | **S3 / MinIO** | Stores large artifacts such as documents, logs, or AI-generated outputs. |

---

## 3. Data Flow (Simplified)
1. **Trigger:** External event (from n8n, API call, or dashboard input).
2. **Processing:** FastAPI routes to LangGraph for reasoning and execution.
3. **Context Retrieval:** LangGraph queries PGVector for relevant context or documents.
4. **AI Action:** LangGraph performs reasoning, tool calls, and decision loops.
5. **Persistence:** Results and metrics stored in Postgres and S3.
6. **Visualization:** Dashboard renders metrics, KPIs, and outcomes in real time.

---

## 4. Key Design Principles
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer has a single, focused responsibility.
- **Observable by Design:** All components emit structured logs, metrics, and traces.
- **Secure & Compliant:** Encrypted secrets, masked PII, scoped tokens.
- **Composable:** Reusable primitives, small deployable units.
- **Simple First:** Start with monolithic deployment → evolve to modular microservices as scale demands.

### Client-facing metrics vs. internal telemetry (SMB focus)
- Client-facing dashboards prioritize business outcomes: hours saved/week, cost per task, error rate, turnaround time, and cash-cycle days.
- Internal telemetry (latency, traces, token cost) remains available for engineering reliability but is not the centerpiece of client reporting.
- Every workflow connects technical spans to business events so that a single run can be tied to a before/after efficiency snapshot.

---

## 5. Versioning & Deployment Strategy
- **Repository:** Monorepo (UI, API, LangGraph, Docs) with semantic versioning.
- **Versioning:** MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH with changelogs and tags per module.
- **Deployment:**
  - Local: Docker Compose.
  - Staging: Cloud containers with tracing enabled.
  - Production: Managed Postgres, object storage, autoscaling APIs.
- **Integration:** n8n communicates with FastAPI endpoints via secure REST calls.

## 6. Technology Stack (Summary)
| Domain | Technology |
|---------|-------------|
| Frontend | Streamlit / React / Next.js |
| Backend | FastAPI / LangGraph / Python 3.12 |
| Storage | Postgres / PGVector / MinIO |
| Observability | Prometheus / Grafana / OpenTelemetry |
| Integrations | n8n / Webhooks / REST APIs |
| Infrastructure | Docker / Fly.io / Render / Kubernetes (optional) |

> Reporting convention for SMBs: public dashboards show business KPIs first; a secondary tab can expose technical health (latency, errors, costs) for operational transparency when needed.
